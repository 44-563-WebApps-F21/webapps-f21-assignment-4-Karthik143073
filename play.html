    <p1 class="stage-direction">[Languidly_._]</p1> 
    <p2 class="speech">I don’t know that I am much interested in your family
life, Lane.</p2>

<h5 class="name LANE">LANE.</h5>
<p3 class="speech">No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it
myself.</p3>

<h5 class="name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
<p4 class="speech">Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.</p4>

<h5 class="name LANE">LANE.</h5>
<p5 class="speech">Thank you, sir. </p5>

<h5 class="name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
<p6 class="speech">Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders
don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They
seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.</p6>

<p7 class="stage-direction">[Enter Lane.]</p7>

<h5 class="name LANE">LANE.</h5>
<P8 class="speech">Mr. Ernest Worthing.</P8>

<p9 class="stage-direction">[Enter Jack.]</p9>

<p10 class="stage-direction">[Lane goes out_._]</p10>

<h5 class="name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
<p11 class="speech">How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?</p11>

<h5>JACK.</h5>
<p12 class="speech">Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as
usual, I see, Algy!</p12>

<h5 class="name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
<p13 class="stage-direction">[Stiffly_._] </p13>
<p14 class="speech">I believe it is customary in good society to take some
slight refreshment at five o’clock. Where have you been since last
Thursday?</p14>

<h5 class="name JACK">JACK.</h5>
<p15 class="speech"> In the country.</p15>

<h5 class="name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
<p16 class="speech">What on earth do you do there?</p16>

<h5 class="name JACK">JACK.</h5>
<p17 class="speech"> When one is in town one amuses oneself.
When one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively
boring.</p17>

<h5 class="name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
<p18 class="speech">And who are the people you amuse?</p18>

<h5 class="name JACK">JACK.</h5>
<p19 class="stage-direction">[Airily_._]</p19> 
<p20 class="speech">Oh, neighbours, neighbours.</p20>

<h5 class="name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
<p21 class="speech">Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?</p21>

<h5 class="name JACK">JACK.</h5>
<p22 class="speech">Perfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.</p22>

<h5 class="name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
<p23 class="speech">How immensely you must amuse them! [Goes over and takes sandwich.] By
the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?</p23>

<h5 class="name JACK">JACK.</h5>
<p24 class="speech">Eh? Shropshire? Yes, of course. Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber
sandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is
coming to tea?</p24>
