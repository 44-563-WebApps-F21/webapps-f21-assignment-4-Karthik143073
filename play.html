        <p>Morning-room in Algernon’s flat in Half-Moon Street. The room is

            ALGERNON.
[Languidly_._] I don’t know that I am much interested in your family
life, Lane.<br>

LANE.
No, sir; it is not a very interesting subject. I never think of it
myself.<br>

ALGERNON.
Very natural, I am sure. That will do, Lane, thank you.<br>

LANE.
Thank you, sir. [Lane goes out.]<br>

ALGERNON.
Lane’s views on marriage seem somewhat lax. Really, if the lower orders
don’t set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They
seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility.

[Enter Lane.]<br>

LANE.
Mr. Ernest Worthing.

[Enter Jack.]

[Lane goes out_._]<br>

ALGERNON.
How are you, my dear Ernest? What brings you up to town?<br>

JACK.
Oh, pleasure, pleasure! What else should bring one anywhere? Eating as
usual, I see, Algy!<br>

ALGERNON.
[Stiffly_._] I believe it is customary in good society to take some
slight refreshment at five o’clock. Where have you been since last
Thursday?<br>

JACK.
[Sitting down on the sofa.] In the country.<br>

ALGERNON.
What on earth do you do there?<br>

JACK.
[Pulling off his gloves_._] When one is in town one amuses oneself.
When one is in the country one amuses other people. It is excessively
boring.<br>

ALGERNON.
And who are the people you amuse?<br>

JACK.
[Airily_._] Oh, neighbours, neighbours.<br>

ALGERNON.
Got nice neighbours in your part of Shropshire?<br>

JACK.
Perfectly horrid! Never speak to one of them.<br>

ALGERNON.
How immensely you must amuse them! [Goes over and takes sandwich.] By
the way, Shropshire is your county, is it not?<br>

JACK.
Eh? Shropshire? Yes, of course. Hallo! Why all these cups? Why cucumber
sandwiches? Why such reckless extravagance in one so young? Who is
coming to tea?<br>
