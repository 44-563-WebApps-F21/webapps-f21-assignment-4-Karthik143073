    <h5 class="name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>

    <p1>I haven’t the smallest intention of doing anything of the kind. To
    begin with, I dined there on Monday, and once a week is quite enough to
    dine with one’s own relations. In the second place, whenever I do dine
    there I am always treated as a member of the family, and sent down with
    either no woman at all, or two. In the third place, I know perfectly
    well whom she will place me next to, to-night. She will place me next
    Mary Farquhar, who always flirts with her own husband across the
    dinner-table. That is not very pleasant. Indeed, it is not even decent
    . . . and that sort of thing is enormously on the increase. The amount
    of women in London who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly
    scandalous. It looks so bad. It is simply washing one’s clean linen in
    public. Besides, now that I know you to be a confirmed Bunburyist I
    naturally want to talk to you about Bunburying. I want to tell you the
    rules.</p1>
    
    <h5 class="name JACK">JACK.</h5>
    <P2>I’m not a Bunburyist at all. If Gwendolen accepts me, I am going to
    kill my brother, indeed I think I’ll kill him in any case. Cecily is a
    little too much interested in him. It is rather a bore. So I am going
    to get rid of Ernest. And I strongly advise you to do the same with Mr.
    . . . with your invalid friend who has the absurd name.</P2>
    
    <h5 class="name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
    <P3>Nothing will induce me to part with Bunbury, and if you ever get
    married, which seems to me extremely problematic, you will be very glad
    to know Bunbury. A man who marries without knowing Bunbury has a very
    tedious time of it.</P3>
    
    <h5 class="name JACK">JACK.</h5>
    <P4>That is nonsense. If I marry a charming girl like Gwendolen, and she is
    the only girl I ever saw in my life that I would marry, I certainly
    won’t want to know Bunbury.</P4>
    
    <h5 class="name ALGERNON">ALGERNON.</h5>
    <P5>Then your wife will. You don’t seem to realise, that in married life
    three is company and two is none.</P5>
    
    <h5 class="name JACK">JACK.</h5>
    <p6 class="stage-direction">[Sententiously.] </p6>
    <P7>That, my dear young friend, is the theory that the
    corrupt French Drama has been propounding for the last fifty years.</P7>
